## Introduction
This notebook details the creation of interactive maps using `leaftlet` and a data set of earthquakes in Missouri. We created the shapefiles referenced here in `CreateQuakes.Rmd` and `CountyQuakes.Rmd`.

## Project Set Up
Before proceeding, we'll make sure our notebook is set up to work with our project data structure.

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())
```

See `CreateQuakes.Rmd` for an explanation of how this function works.
